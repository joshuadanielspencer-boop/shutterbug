# Keyboard & focus audit — 2026-07-21

Rule 4 requires full keyboard operation with visible focus states. This is the
first time that has actually been *tested* rather than assumed. Nothing here has
been fixed yet — this is the findings list, in the order I'd fix it.

**How it was tested.** The running dev build was driven with real `Tab` / `Enter`
keystrokes (not synthetic events, which don't move focus), with a capture-phase
`focusin` listener recording every element focus reached, its computed outline,
and whether it sat inside the open dialog. Contrast ratios were computed from the
live page's own resolved colours. Findings marked **measured** were observed in
the running game; findings marked **read** come from the source and have not been
reproduced live yet.

## The good news first

These were genuinely surprising, and they mean the job is smaller than feared:

- **Every focusable control has a focus ring.** The `:where(...)` zero-specificity
  floor at `src/shutterbug-world.jsx:5572` really does reach everything — all 17
  controls on the map screen, all 5 on the bag screen, all 17 on the mode picker
  came back with `outline: 3px solid rgb(240,165,0)`. (measured)
- **The core loop is fully keyboard-operable.** On the country map the four city
  pins are real tab stops in a sensible order — checklist, then pins, then the
  right rail — each with `Enter`/`Space` handlers and their own focus treatment
  (`.sbw-pin:focus-visible`, coral stroke + scale at `:5601`). Focusing a pin also
  reveals its name via `onFocus`, so the "names hide until hover" behaviour has a
  keyboard equivalent. (measured)
- **No keyboard-unreachable controls.** Every `onClick` on a `div`/`span`/`g` in
  the file is either a backdrop dismiss or a `stopPropagation` shim — there is no
  case of a real action hidden on a non-focusable element. (read)
- **Tab order follows the DOM and the DOM follows the layout**, with two small
  exceptions noted below. No positive `tabindex` anywhere.

## Findings

### 1. The focus ring fails contrast on every light surface — **measured**

WCAG 2.2 SC 1.4.11 requires **3:1** for a focus indicator. Measured against the
game's own backgrounds:

| Background | Gold `#F0A500` ring |
|---|---|
| Cream paper `#F4ECD8` | **1.77:1** ✗ |
| White card `#FFFFFF` | **2.08:1** ✗ |
| Selected pink `#FBEAE6` | **1.79:1** ✗ |
| Coral button `#E15C42` | **1.74:1** ✗ |
| Header teal `#1F4E5A` | 4.39:1 ✓ |
| Dark wood `#4A3214` | 5.74:1 ✓ |

The ring was chosen for the dark chrome, where it's excellent — but most of the
game's buttons sit on paper. Ink `#10262E` is the mirror image (13–15:1 on paper,
1.3–2.2:1 on the dark chrome), so **no single colour works everywhere**.

**Fix:** a two-tone ring — ink inner band, gold outer band. Whichever surface a
control sits on, one band always clears 3:1, and gold stays the colour of the
thing so it still reads as Shutterbug. One rule change at `:5572`, plus the three
map-specific treatments (`.sbw-pin`, `.sbw-cont`, `.sbw-country`) which set
`outline: none` and would need the same two-tone logic in their own idiom.

### 2. No modal traps focus, and none restores it on close — **measured**

Thirteen elements declare `role="dialog" aria-modal="true"`. None of them behaves
like a modal to the keyboard.

With the passport open, `Tab` walked through **all seven background controls**
first — Back, Ana, Guest, New traveler, passport, Customize, Continue — before
reaching the passport's own Close button on the eighth press. `aria-modal="true"`
is a promise to assistive tech that the rest of the page is inert; right now that
promise is false, which is worse than not making it.

Two related gaps, same cause:
- **Focus doesn't move into the dialog when it opens.** Opening the passport left
  `document.activeElement` on `<body>`. (measured)
- **Focus doesn't return to the trigger when it closes.** After closing the
  passport, `activeElement` was `<body>` again — a keyboard user is dumped back to
  the top of the page and has to re-tab to where they were. (measured)

**Fix:** one small `useFocusTrap(ref, onClose)` hook — remember the trigger, move
focus to the first control (or the dialog itself), cycle Tab/Shift-Tab within,
restore on unmount. Applied at 13 call sites. Six of them already have `autoFocus`
on their primary button, which covers the "move in" half but not the trap or the
restore.

### 3. Six modals can't be dismissed with Escape — **read**

Escape is handled in five places (`:5883`, `:5903`, `:6022`, `:6423`, `:7008`).
Missing from:

| Component | Line | Should Escape close it? |
|---|---|---|
| `TravelChooser` | 6271 | **Yes** — it's a choice with a Cancel |
| `AvatarEditor` | 6669 | **Yes** |
| `CreateTravelerModal` | 6758 | **Yes** |
| `CountryPopup` (arrival) | 6962 | **Yes** |
| tool-note popup | 5466 | **Yes** |
| `ResultModal` | 6363 | **No — deliberate.** Escaping past a result skips a fact the child hasn't read. Leave it. |
| `RiddleModal` | 7119 | **Probably not** — same reasoning; it's a question to answer, not a thing to dismiss. Your call. |

The focus-trap hook from finding 2 is the natural home for the Escape handler, so
these land together.

### 4. The bag screen has no live region — **measured**

`document.querySelectorAll('[aria-live],[role="status"],[role="alert"]')` returns
**empty** on the pack-the-bag screen. Picking the second item silently: enables
"Set off", and turns the third item `disabled` (removing it from the tab order
with no announcement). A sighted mouse user sees all this; a screen-reader user
gets nothing.

The item buttons themselves are good — `aria-pressed` is correct and the ✓ is in
the accessible name, so re-focusing an item does announce its state.

**Fix:** a `role="status"` line reading "2 of 2 packed — Jonah's other offer stays
behind", which doubles as a visible affordance the screen currently lacks.

### 5. Two small tab-order oddities — **measured**

- On the splash, the three greeting bubbles come *before* "Begin your adventure",
  and "How to play" comes *after* it. A first-time player pressing Tab hits three
  decorative sound buttons before the button they want. (`Enter` fixes this — the
  global handler presses `[data-primary]` — but Enter isn't advertised, on purpose.)
- On the mode picker, "← Back to travelers" is the **last** tab stop but sits
  visually top-left.

Neither is a blocker. The splash one is worth a re-order; the Back one is
conventional enough to leave.

### 6. Not a keyboard bug, but found while measuring — **measured**

Three screens overflow a 1280×720 window and scroll: play `780px`, mode picker
`822px`, pack-the-bag `855px`. On the bag screen the primary action ("Set off")
starts below the fold. Keyboard users are fine — the browser scrolls focus into
view — but mouse users must scroll to reach the button that starts the run. This
overlaps Joshua's own Long Trip feedback about scrolling and is filed there too.

## Also worth recording

`CLAUDE.md` says "144 places". `src/data/locations.js` now holds **447** across
**106 countries**. Worth a one-line correction next time that file is touched.

## Suggested order

1. Two-tone focus ring (finding 1) — one CSS rule + three map treatments, fixes
   the most-used surface in the game.
2. `useFocusTrap` hook + Escape (findings 2 and 3) — one hook, 13 call sites.
3. Bag-screen live region (finding 4).
4. Splash tab order (finding 5).

Findings 1 and 2 are the ones that matter. 3 and 4 are cheap once 2 is in.
